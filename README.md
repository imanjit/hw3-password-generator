## Application

When the user presses the "Generate Password" button, prompt the user to select how many characters they would like their password to be. Once they choose a character length between 8 and 128, they will be prompted on whether they would like to include:
* Uppercase letters
* Lowercase letters
* Numbers
* Special Characters

## Challenges

Currently the biggest challenge is getting the password to display.
